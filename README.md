Education Platform - reimagining education with complimentary tools for educators.
<h2>Package Dependencies</h2>
For testing purposed I have bower installed angular and angular-mocks.  There is much debate over whether to include bower_components
in the .gitignore file.  At this time, I have chosen to leave it out. Manually install it to run the tests 

<h2>Vision</h2>
A flexible, affordable tool that helps teachers to bring their best resources to one easy control panel for quick access and use to support their classroom.

Tools for reinventing the modern education system

A suite for creating tests for students that reaches the students needs and gives students and teachers immediate feedback.  Or allows teachers to easily plug in their favorite testing suites.
